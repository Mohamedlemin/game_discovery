Develop a full-stack job tracker application that helps users organize and manage their job search process. The application should allow users to create profiles, search for job listings, save favorite jobs, track application statuses, and set reminders for follow-ups. Features should include user authentication, job listing integration (via APIs or web scraping), custom tagging and categorization of jobs, and resume/CV management. Additionally, implement features such as analytics for job application progress and email integration for communication with potential employers. The project should be completed within three weeks by a single developer.
